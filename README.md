# MyRecursiveFunction
Used as a demo to git and to introduce recursives functions

Here are the operations to follow:

 * Create a new project on Code::Blocks to host this new project (suggested name: "MyRecursiveFunctions").
 * Implement the Factorial function with a loop for. Compile it, test it,...
 * Initialize your working dir with git and commit files main.c
 * "git status" and make it that files not pertinent are ignored (hint: use a .gitignore file)
 * Add a remote to Github
 * Make the factorial computation a function
 * Commit it
 * Branch it
 * Make it a recursive function
 * Commit it
 * Checkout to master to hotfix a missing comment
 * Commit it
 * Merge the two versions
